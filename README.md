# CSIC 5011 / MATH 5473 Final Project <br>Imagingâ€™s Potential to Assist in COVID-19 Crisis
> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
> An efficient and accu-rate abnormalities detection in chest X-rays (CXR) of infected patients can assisthealth care staff in the battle against COVID-19.
> 
> We investigate the potential of synthetic images additional to existing dataset to improveCOVID-19 CXR classification accuracy.
